# Connectria Stackstorm Common Libraries

## Overview
`connectria_stackstorm_common` is a centralized repository for StackStorm (st2) common libraries. It's designed to standardize and streamline the development of StackStorm packs by providing reusable and well-maintained code modules within Connectria.

## Purpose
This repository hosts essential libraries, like `crypto`, for common functionalities needed across different StackStorm packs. It helps in maintaining consistency, enhancing security, and reducing redundancy in code.

## Contribution Guidelines
- **Identify Common Needs:** If you have functionalities in your packs that can be abstracted into a common library, consider contributing.
- **Develop and Document:** Create your library in a dedicated folder, complete with documentation and unit tests.
- **Collaborate:** Submit your library via pull requests

## Usage
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Connectria/connectria_stackstorm_common.git`
- Navigate to the desired library, and follow the specific instructions in its `README.md`.
